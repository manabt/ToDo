A simple to-do list application that interacts with a JSONPlaceholder API, using Fetch API, to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on to-do items and adds them to the DOM:
<br><br>
- Sends a PUT request to update the completion status of a to-do item on the server by one click.<br>
- Deletes a to-do item from the DOM and the server when double-clicked.
